## Our Goal: 
The primary aim of this project is to reduce the money spent by gamers while maximizing fun (games played by the user).
  •	Customers can register/login with their respective information.
  •	Customers can view the CD’s available for trade.
  •	Customers can also view game CD’s to be bought from our huge collection of game CD’s.
  •	We have also provided a community chat, where users can chat/converse with all other users of the community.

## Reasons for building:
• Nowadays people cannot afford to buy multiple game CD’s for their PlayStation (PS),Xbox or PC(personal computer)
• Each CD costs a minimum of    2000 RS or more .Everyone likes to play games , the more they play the better.
• The majority that plays games are college going students who don’t earn enough money to buy a new game CD.
• Even for working individuals spending more than 4000 RS just to play a new game is not reasonable .
• This applications provides a solution for such problems.
